# Previous tasks

-   [X] Setup notes
-   [X] Look into Covid extension rules
    Apply in last 3 months

-   [X] Look into [Eugene's repo](https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games) for Sequential Social Dilemmas
    It still uses RGB inputs, so I don't see the reason to switch from Melting Pot to this

-   [X] Finish sharing JAAMAS paper code
    Done: <https://github.com/Muff2n/reward_transfer_matrix>

I have also looked into [JaxMARL](https://blog.foersterlab.com/jaxmarl/) and [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji). JaxMARL looks very raw and would be hard to use. JaxMARL is a definite possibility, but only has one game that could be considered a slight social dilemma - Connector.


# Meeting notes

-   [ALPMPICS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03220.pdf) could be a starting environment, and [K-Level Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01521.pdf) would be a potential method.
-   Work with Shuqing on the Sequential Social Dilemmas


# Future tasks

-   [ ] Create API key using budget and share
-   [ ] Run ALYMPICS with iterated prisoner's dilemma
-   [ ] Pick a target ML conference - AAAI, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML as well as AAMAS
-   [ ] Chat with Shuqing about working with him
