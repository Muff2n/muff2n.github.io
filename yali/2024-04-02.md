# Previous tasks

-   [X] Setup notes
-   [X] Look into Covid extension rules
    Apply in last 3 months
-   [X] Look into [Eugene's repo](https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games) for Sequential Social Dilemmas
    It still uses RGB inputs, so I don't see the reason to switch from Melting Pot to this
-   [X] Finish sharing JAAMAS paper code
    Done: <https://github.com/Muff2n/reward_transfer_matrix>

I have also looked into [JaxMARL](https://blog.foersterlab.com/jaxmarl/) and [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji). JaxMARL looks very raw and would be hard to use. JaxMARL is a definite possibility, but only has one game that could be considered a slight social dilemma - Connector.
